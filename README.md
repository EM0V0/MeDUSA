## 📖 Overview

**MeDUSA** (Medical Device Unified Security & Analytics) is an open-source educational platform designed to teach medical device cybersecurity through hands-on experience. Built as a realistic Parkinson's disease tremor monitoring system, MeDUSA provides students with a safe, controlled environment to learn and practice security concepts critical to healthcare technology.

### Why MeDUSA?

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) 3.x or later
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (for backend deployment)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### One-Command Setup (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EM0V0/MeDUSA.git
cd MeDUSA

# Quick start with demo mode
.\scripts\quick_start.ps1 -Mode dev
```

### Manual Setup

#### Frontend (Flutter App)
```powershell
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome    # For web
flutter run -d windows   # For Windows desktop
```

#### Backend (Local Development)
```powershell
cd backend/backend-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
.\start_local.ps1
```

### 🎮 Demo Mode
No hardware device? No problem! MeDUSA includes a **Demo Mode** that generates realistic simulated tremor data:

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Click the **"Demo Mode"** button
3. Watch real-time simulated tremor visualization
4. Click **"Trigger Episode"** to simulate a Parkinsonian tremor event

This is perfect for demonstrations, training sessions, and learning without physical devices.
