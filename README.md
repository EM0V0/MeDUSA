## Overview

**MeDUSA** (Medical Device Universal Security Alignment) is an open-source educational platform designed to teach medical device cybersecurity through hands-on experience. Built as a realistic Parkinson's disease tremor monitoring system, MeDUSA provides students with a safe, controlled environment to learn and practice security concepts critical to healthcare technology.

### Why MeDUSA?

The medical device industry faces a critical shortage of cybersecurity professionals who understand both healthcare requirements and security principles. Traditional classroom instruction often fails to provide the practical experience needed to develop real-world skills. MeDUSA addresses this gap by offering:

- **Real-World Simulation**: A fully functional medical device ecosystem
- **Security-First Design**: Implementations following FDA guidance and industry standards  
- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: From basic concepts to advanced penetration testing
- **Practical Labs**: Hands-on exercises with intentional vulnerabilities to discover and fix

## Features

### Clinical Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time Tremor Monitoring** | Live visualization of Parkinsonian tremor data with Demo Mode |
| **Patient Management** | Complete CRUD operations for patient records |
| **Device Integration** | BLE-based medical device pairing and data collection |
| **Data Analytics** | Statistical analysis with frequency domain processing |
| **Multi-Role Access** | Patient, Doctor, and Administrator interfaces |

### Security Features
| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | JWT-based auth with mandatory MFA (TOTP) |
| **Password Security** | Argon2id hashing with NIST-compliant validation |
| **Encryption** | TLS 1.3 for all communications |
| **Access Control** | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (for backend deployment)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### One-Command Setup (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EM0V0/MeDUSA.git
cd MeDUSA

# Quick start with demo mode
.\scripts\quick_start.ps1 -Mode dev
```

### Manual Setup

#### Frontend (Flutter App)
```powershell
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome    # For web
flutter run -d windows   # For Windows desktop
```

#### Backend (Local Development)
```powershell
cd backend/backend-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
.\start_local.ps1
```

### Demo Mode
No hardware device? No problem! MeDUSA includes a **Demo Mode** that generates realistic simulated tremor data:

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Click the **"Demo Mode"** button
3. Watch real-time simulated tremor visualization
4. Click **"Trigger Episode"** to simulate a Parkinsonian tremor event

This is perfect for demonstrations, training sessions, and learning without physical devices.
